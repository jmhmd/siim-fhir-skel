# siim-fhir-skel
Skeleton for creating FHIR assets to match TCGA image data for the SIIM Hackathon

# Organization
This skeleton contains a set of top-level directories that correspond with the FHIR Resources: http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/resourcelist.html

This should make it easier for end users to load the information that they want without having to load everything.  

Each patient should have their own directory tree, so that it's easy to keep resources organized.
